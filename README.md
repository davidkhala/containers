> Devs loved Docker and it was obvious they were here to stay.
> Knowing that, we set out to create a developer-first interface to containers.
> Because the best interface for developers is code, we built Testcontainers â€“ an open-source multi-language library for providing throwaway, lightweight instances of databases, message brokers, web browsers, or just about anything that can run in a Docker container.
> Define your dependencies as code, then simply run your tests or local development environment and containers will be created and then deleted, all without leaving the IDE.
> No more need for mocks or complicated environment configurations.
